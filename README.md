# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio under my internet psudeonym "DrMixxer" which i initally came up with "Blender" but it was the same as the software blender so i changed it to Mixxes and then ohmixxes when i used to play MC more, know its DrMixxer despite the fact im neither a Dr or a Mixxer.

# Site blueprints
The site is built with HTML (Hyper-text markup language) and CSS w/ Tailwind, i was considering Angular or React but the application is much to simple in my opinion, i also used skilicons to add icons, and used googlefonts for the fonts.

# Usage of code
Under the GNU license you are not allowed to use my code, but if you happen to use it please credit me.

# Hosting
Im planing on purchasing a Domain and hosting soon but the site is still unfinished.
